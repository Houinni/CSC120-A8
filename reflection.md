Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent? 
It represents a superhero character in video game. The character could perform actions in the contract.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I added a getPosition() method to keep track of the character's location, and I overloaded the shrink, grow, and walk methods to accept parameters, providing more control over the character's actions and location.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think all the methods worked as expected based on the results from the testing class. It would have been better if I could have implemented more complex methods for this assignment. However, I had a busy week, which didn't leave me much time to experiment. Ideally, I would have liked to create a world map for the characters and limit their choice of items, with specific features.
